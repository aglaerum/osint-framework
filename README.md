# OSINT Framework - Mobile Responsive Fork

**[🔗 Access the iPhone-friendly site here](https://aglaerum.github.io/osint-framework)**

A mobile-optimized version of the OSINT Framework, focused on providing a better experience on smartphones and tablets.

## What's Different

This fork adds mobile compatibility to the original OSINT Framework:

- **Responsive design** - Adapts to any screen size
- **iPhone 16 Pro optimized** - Works great on modern iOS devices
- **Touch-friendly** - Larger tap targets and optimized interactions
- **Auto-resize** - Handles orientation changes smoothly
- **iOS safe areas** - Respects notches and Dynamic Island

The core functionality and OSINT resource collection remain unchanged.

## Original Repository

This is a fork of the excellent [OSINT Framework by Justin Nordine (@jnordine)](https://github.com/lockfale/osint-framework).

All credit for the OSINT Framework concept, design, and resource curation goes to the original project. Please visit the official site at **https://osintframework.com** for the latest updates and to contribute new resources.
